here's the proposed database schema:

**1. Sales**

   - `StockNumber`: Text/String
   - `VehicleMake`: Text/String
   - `ActualCashValue`: Float
   - `TradeInAllowance`: Float
   - `GrossProfit`: Float
   - `Total`: Float
   - `EmployeeID`: Foreign Key (Refers to `Employees.EmployeeID`)
   - `CustomerID`: Foreign Key (Refers to `Customers.CustomerID`)
   - `FinancingID`: Foreign Key (Refers to `Financing.FinancingID`)
   - `TradeInID`: Foreign Key (Refers to `TradeIns.TradeInID`)

**2. Employees**

**3. Customers**
   - `CustomerID`: Primary Key (Auto-incremented integer)

**Relationships:**
- One sale can be associated with one employee, one customer, one financing method, and one trade-in.
 However, one employee can be associated with many sales, one customer can have many sales,
 one financing method can be used in many sales, and there can be many trade-ins associated with various sales.
