Author(s) of the component: Ryan S
Inspected by: Amirali Zandkarimi
Inspection Checklist
General:
Does the code provide the related functionality required?  ✓

this component provides the dashboard with the
context
Is there no redundant code? ✓
there are no redundancies that change the functionality of the code but there
are some improvements that can be made:
e.g there is a redundent Employee ID check in filterSalesByEmployee Function(lines
122-128) that can be rewritten like this:


function filterSalesByEmployee(sales:SaleWithEmployeeAndFinancingType[],employee:Employee | 
 undefined) {
     			console.log('employee', employee, 'sales: ', sales)
     			return sales.filter((sale) => sale.EmployeeID === employee?.id)
 		}



Another example is getEmployeeSales inside the useEffect function (Lines 73
112). This function can be defined outside the useEffect to improve readability
and reusability.
Are all functions called at least once? ✓

Is the code self explanatory? ✓

The code is very well structured and follows the common standard patterns of react.js.
Is the code as small as feasibly possible? ✓
Size of the code is reasonable.

Security:
Is sensitive information being sent to the database encrypted, and being retrieved encrypted? ~
Are sensitive program information (i.e. access keys, admin passwords, etc.) being blocked from view via environment variables or the like? ~
Are calls to the database being sanitized (i.e. item’; DROP TABLE table;)? ~

The inspected component is not explicitly interacting with sensitive data such
as access keys, admin passwords, etc.

Testing:
Are test cases generated for this item in codeallergy? ✓

There is a set of test cases for the dashboard component in the codeallergy that
tests different components of the the dashboard. dashboard-provider fetches and
manages the necessary data from data base for those components so this component
is getting tested by extension.

Are all test cases being passed? ✓

All the test cases seem to execute to completion.

Are test cases similar to previously generated test cases? ~
Typescript Specific
Database Update/Create Defects
Are any database calls updating/manipulating columns (should not)? 

There are no explicit database updates or manipulations in this component

Are any sensitive information/password related database calls being hashed and/or unencrypted? (In simpler terms, is sensitive information hashed prior to being sent?)

There are no explicit handling of sensitive information like passwords in this
component. dashboard-provider mainly fetches insensitive data from the data base
and displays it on the dashboard

Backend Reference
Are backend references done with the database wrapper library?
If not, are the fetches in accordance with the supabase API? 
If not, are the keys being inputted to the connection function with environment variables? 

All the functions used in this component (getAllSales, getAllEmployees,
getAllSalesGoals) are using Supabase client which is the wrapper library for
database interactions
The usage of .from('Sales'), .from('SalesGoals'), and .from('Employees') is in
accordance with the Supabase API.

Are calls to the backend being done with the imported supabase instance? 

Yes, calls to the backend are done with the imported Supabase instance created
by getSupabaseBrowserClient. The Supabase URL and anonymous key are fetched from
environment variables (process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL and
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY).

Are calls to the backend hidden from view in reference to the user? 

The calls to the backend such as fetching sales, sales goals, and employees, are
not visible to the user. These operations are performed on the server or
backend.

Are all columns that are non-null being posted to the database in any given call? 

The select('*') in the queries retrieves all columns from the specified tables.
Frontend Defects 

Are all components returning type JSX? ✓

Yes, the DashboardPage component is returning JSX

Are all pages being separated into the smallest components possible? ✓

components (Button, Card, Tabs, etc.) are from different modules

Are all interaction widgets onUseEffects (i.e a buttons onClick) being encapsulated into a separate function calls? ✓

Yes

Are all components in a page being imported into the main page.tsx? ✓

Yes, components like Button, Card, Tabs, CalendarDateRangePicker, Overview, and

RecentSales are imported and used within the DashboardPage component.

If there is conditional rendering, is the correct role being checked? ~
