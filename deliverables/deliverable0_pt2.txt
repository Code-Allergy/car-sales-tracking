Description of Project

The software will track sales of vehicles for Riverside Dodge, a car dealership in Prince Albert. The software will need to be able to add, delete, and modify sales, attach sales of new and used cars to specific people within the system 
(salespeople, sales managers, and finance employees), and have monthly and yearly summaries of sales made, which is to be sorted for all employees or only for some. Additionally, there must be two types of access: read-only as well as read
and edit, which is dependent on role. There must also be a way to export data in tabloid and graph format, or both, and be able to compare the data with estimates. The project must be able to have data shared between different computers
and any edits made to be accessible across all instances of the project.

The need for the project is that it fills a gap that Riverside Dodge has, which specifically concerns collecting data about sales. Their current way of handling this has less features than they would like.

The stakeholder is Riverside Dodge, specifically Cameron Bates, a managing partner and Chief Financial Officer of the company. He can be contacted at 306-980-8375 or by email at Cameronbates@riversidedodge.ca.

The technology, at this moment, will be web-based, meaning that access can happen across multiple computers. The languages used, as of right now, will be MySQL, Javascript, and React.
